# To Do List App

The purpose of this application is to let users track their daily to-do tasks in a user friendly environment.
On the home screen, you will be asked to enter as many tasks as necessary. Ultimately, the tasks your typed 
into the input space will be rendered onto the page.

## Getting Started 

There are two ways in which you can access the files in this repository. You can either clone the files with the git clone command or by downloading the zip file onto your computer. Once you've download the files, you need to acess the dependencies by running ```npm i``` on your command line.

## Running the app
Once your dependencies have been installed on the project, you can open the project by typing ```npm run start``` on your command line. The command will initialize the React application and run the server.

To close the server and the react appliction , you can either type ```command + z``` on the command or just exit the browser.
